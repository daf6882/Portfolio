Questions to think about:
1. Are parking violations cyclical? Is there a time of year, or season, when there are more parking violations? My guess is that there are more in the summer time.
2. Is there a time of day that more parking violations are committed? My guess would be around lunch time.
3. Which agency tends to write the most tickets? Is there a particular time of year, i.e. month, day, time?
4. What is the most common violation?
5. What is the most common fine amount?

# comment1: interesting, looks like people tend to commit parking violations more during the Winter

# comment1: while I do like this one, I think I'm going to do the number of citations as oppose to fine amount. I feel like it's hard to discern what the graphic is saying.
# comment2: I think I'm going to find the average fine amount per day and calculate the difference for each hour
# comment3: On second thought, I'm going to find the total number of tickets issued per hour, and then the average fine. I'll make two plots, one will have the number issued per hour, and the second will be the average fine amount per hour
